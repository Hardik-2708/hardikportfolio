                          -  Challenge: Since the project was developed using both Angular Material and MUI (Material-UI), ensuring a uniform design across both frameworks was crucial.
                        Solution:
                           - Established a design system in Figma, defining typography, spacing, and component behavior.
                           - Created a shared UI component library to maintain consistency across Angular and React.
                           - Standardized design tokens and themes to reduce UI discrepancies.
